# World-Of-Color
Inspired by the closing of amusement parks and cancellation of social events amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, "World of Color" is an interactive virtual simulation of the beloved night-time Disney show.

Users create virtual water fountains with colors and shapes of their own choosing, and there is also a feature of suspending the fountains in air.
